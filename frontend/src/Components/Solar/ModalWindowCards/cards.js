        "The model is designed to investigate the problem of carbon sequestration in relation to climate change using the Great Lakes as an example. Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It is one of the mechanisms for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to mitigate global climate change. The frequency, duration, and intensity of precipitation, ambient air temperature, and water temperature reflect the impacts of climate change. A decrease in precipitation, increased evaporation, and altered runoff patterns threaten the viability of wetlands, bogs, and other vulnerable habitats. Nutrient pollution and invasive species further exacerbate these issues, leading to water quality degradation and impaired ecosystem functioning.",

Climate change leads to the reduction of habitat for cold-water commercial fish species, increases interspecies competition, and facilitates the emergence of invasive fish species. Contributing factors include reduced ice cover, increased temperature or precipitation, and enhanced downwelling longwave radiation. By reducing wave impact on shallow waters, ice cover influences the physical conditions for fish whose eggs are spawned in winter. Rising temperatures affect dissolved oxygen concentration in surface waters, which exhibits seasonal and daily cycles. When oxygen solubility is limited, prevailing hypoxia can impose additional stress on fish while simultaneously allowing invasive species to dominate.",

In dry years, households suffer from feed shortages on mountain pastures and, to save their priority breeding herd from dying, use the roots of the perennial leguminous shrub Jombwe as fodder. However, digging up the tubers requires significant labor. Livestock productivity is affected by disease and predation by wild animals.

Residents engage in crop farming, which provides food for the households. They procure seeds, fencing materials, and diesel fuel for field irrigation from outside. Game meat, crops from household gardens and fields, as well as small livestock such as goats and chickens, are sold to earn income during droughts. Wild animals and birds directly reduce overall yields. The available labor force determines total food production. After a failed harvest, most family members begin working for wealthier households, losing time for their own crops. Two social practices help restore livelihoods after drought: leasing livestock to those who lost animals during droughts and collective neighbor assistance in fieldwork during periods of peak labor demand and shortage. Fewer border restrictions provide greater flexibility in accessing food across borders.",

The model includes factors affecting the level of theft: availability of property (visible presence of items desired by thieves), opportunity (physical access to property, availability of burglary tools, etc.), community involvement (urban surveillance, neighbor communication, crime reports in local news), police presence (visible deployment of officers on a regular basis), punishment (certainty and severity of penalty for crimes), and criminal intent (presence of individuals intending to commit theft).",

Kennedy's televised address to the nation on October 22, 1962, which presented the American view of the crisis and a declaration of the objectives to be pursued by the U.S. administration, as well as his press conference statement on November 22, 1962, containing his assessment of the situation after the crisis resolution. The aim is to determine the most effective decision-making actions based on the perception of the 1962 crisis to advance U.S. interests and ensure peace and security.",

Social forces, such as addiction, family breakdown, and mental illness, are exacerbated by structural forces, including the lack of affordable housing, poor economic conditions, and inadequate mental health services. The factors affecting homelessness arise at the micro, meso, and macro levels of society. The integrated picture enables policy changes to address complex social issues like homelessness.",
