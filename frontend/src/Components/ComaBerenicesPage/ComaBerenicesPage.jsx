        Welcome to the brightest star Al-Dafira in the ancient asterism of the northern sky, Coma Berenices. The first three planets have an ancient civilization; the fifth planet from the star Al-Dafira is completely deserted.

        <h2>Humanoids</h2>

          Inhabitants. The Dafirians have well-defined, austere facial features, stand between two and two and a half meters tall, and possess slender, proportionate bodies with thin arms and long wrists. Their expressive almond-shaped eyes, slightly elongated with dark lashes and thin, arched brows, display very clear segmented detailing of the iris. They can easily and swiftly “move” over considerable distances—20–30 meters in a single “step-jump.” For long-range and rapid travel through space, they use very compact individual flying devices that allow near-instantaneous relocation to any point on the planet or even to any of the star’s planets. All are capable of innate levitation from birth.

        <h2>Housing</h2>
        <p>
          Dafirians live in family units in individual, comfortable structures whose internal layout continuously changes not only in scale but also in shape. The environment shifts in strict accordance with the owner’s inner emotional state. Their dwellings feature spherical roofs adorned with elegant tall crosses that serve a technological role, acting as directional radars and transmitters of high-frequency vibrational energy, functioning as energy purifiers and stabilizers.

        <h2>Knowledge, Management and Technology</h2>

        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          They possess highly advanced science and a high level of technological development.
        </p>

        <h3>Knowledge</h3>
        <p>
          Great emphasis is placed on spiritual development, the level of which determines almost everything. As it increases, not only does access to higher realms of Knowledge and the Cosmic Information Bank expand, but so do individuals’ abilities to harness various forms of energy.
        </p>

        <h3>Governance</h3>
        <p>
          There is a global government <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#3498db", fontSize: "1.2rem", borderRadius: "7px", padding: "0 5px" }}>Akkad</span>, entrusted with the comprehensive administration of the star system. Under it operates a decision-support agency — <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#3498db", fontSize: "1.2rem", borderRadius: "7px", padding: "0 5px" }}>Anum</span> — whose representatives assist in resolving complex issues arising on the planets. Each of the four planets has its own government. These governments can invest resources in the financial instruments of other planets. There is no physical currency. The cryptocurrency is Dafira.
